Project # 2 Full-Stack App:

Fighting Mongooses-Office Meal Ordering App
Overview:
This App is targeting office managers or andministrators tasked ordering lunch for the entire office. 

Barebones MVP:

Models:
The Users Model:
-This model is for our users (customers/office managers in the case of our MVP).  However, we aim to allow restaurants/catering agencies the ability to login and create packages of meals they will offer to groups of customers. Each user will of course have a unique username and pasword to login with. The dynamic, session-based input parameter for each user is the amount of people in their office/group. 

The  Orders Model:
-This model will is where the users will contruct their orders. 


Division of work:
Initially we have divided the MVP into:
Dave: views pages
Joe: Models
Calvin: Project manager role: Everything relating to GitHub, setting up repo, resolving MErge conflicts, completing Readme, file structure and wireframe. then helping with routes until we have a working model. At this point I am going to help with the front end; as well as aiding in any  areas that are lagging. This way we don't have 
Dave will be primarily focused on the backend details including 









Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application
Groups
Will be assigned by your local instructor

Overview
This second project is your first foray into building a full-stack application. You'll be building an Express app, which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

This is exciting! It's a lot, but we gave you the tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

You will be working in pairs for this project, and you'll be designing the app together. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. You will run your user stories, wireframes, and schemas/relations for your data by your instructors to get their feedback before you begin coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Have at least 2 related models (more if they make sense!) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow, Keep this simple, we want you focusing on the logic of the app.
Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
Be deployed online and accessible to the public
(were going to teach you how to deploy on heroku)
Necessary Deliverables
A working full-stack application, built by you, that contains all of the RESTful routes, full CRUD
Bonus: hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, what problem your app solves/why you made it, the approach taken, installation instructions/requirements, contributor information, unsolved problems, forthcoming features, etc. The README.md should also include
(links to) Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
(a link to) User stories you created
Suggested Ways to Get Started
Begin with the end in mind. Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories & data, so you don't waste time building things you don't need. Keep it lean and keep it elegant.
It can be very helpful to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
Use branches on git
Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application. It's tempting to just make them todo lists for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build.
Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something before you code it is critical.

Useful Resources
Heroku (for hosting your back-end)
Writing Good User Stories (for a few user story tips)
Presenting Information Architecture (for more insight into wireframing)
Project Feedback + Evaluation
Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

Deployment and Functionality: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations
0	Incomplete.
1	Does not meet expectations.
2	Meets expectactions, good job!
3	Exceeds expectations, great job!
This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are the individual ones above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
