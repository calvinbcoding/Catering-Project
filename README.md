Project # 2 Full-Stack App:

Fighting Mongooses-Office Meal Ordering App
Overview:
This App is targeting office managers or andministrators tasked ordering lunch for the entire office.

Each user will of course have a unique username and pasword to login with, as well as the orderSchema. 

The  Orders Model:
-This model will is where the uders' orders' will be queried from the database to check and see if they have any past orders, if they do it will pass them to the user model, if not, any orders created by the user will be stored in the database through this model.

Day 1/ Achieving the MVP:
